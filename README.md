# Diamonds EDA
Diamonds features exploration data analysis and visualization.

### IRONHACK Data Analysis - Project II

This repository correspond to the data exploration project performed at IRONHACK Data Analysis Bootcamp.

The original dataset can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivam2503/diamonds).

#### **Purpose**

The project scope is to practice exploration, analysis and visualization of a unknown dataset to find key features and relationships.

It is split in two parts:
    - Dataset analysis performed on Jupyter Notebook.
    - Tableau interactive dashboard hosted in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/pablo5039#!/vizhome/Diamonds_15959547286880/Dashboard15?publish=yes).

The parameters included in the dataset are:

* **Carat**:  diamond weight
* **Cut**:  cut quality
* **Color**:  color
* **Clarity**:  diamond clarity and inclusions
* **Depth**:  relationship between z, x and y: z/mean(x+y). Depth refers to the distance between the culet and the table when the diamond is viewed from the side.
* **Table**:  top horizontal facet, expressed as the relationship with the average girdle diameter. Excellent quality -> 52-62% 
* **Price**  
* **X**:  diamond length
* **Y**:  diamond width
* **Z**:  diamond height

Since this analysis will be used later to train a machine learning algorithm able to predict a diamond price,
Price is the kye feature that guides the data exploration.

### **Tech stack**

- Analysis performed on Jupyter Notebook.
- Used libraries:
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - plotly
